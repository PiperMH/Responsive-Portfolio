				I graduated from Smith College in May of 2016 with a BA degree.   My major was in Studio Art and my minor was in Economics.  At Smith, I pursued coursework in Photography, Visual Studies, and Digital Media as well as business studies such as Sports Economics.  I am proficient in Photoshop, Illustrator and InDesign.   I work well with people and my natural competitiveness drives me to do my best, whatever the task.  I am good natured and enjoy challenges and learning opportunities.</p>  
				<p>While at Smith, I was a 4-year varsity rower in the 1V open eight.  As a freshman, I was named Rookie of the Year across all athletic teams at Smith.   As a senior I was named Varsity Team Captain.  Also as a senior I was named a Pocock All American Athlete (Division III).   I was Cutter House President for two years.   I have proven leadership abilities, excellent time management skills and experience with project management.
